        <li><strong>Two shareholder proposals fail </strong>- Two shareholder
            activists submitted proposals for consideration that eventually failed
            to garner majority support. John Chevedden, known by many as a so-called
            "corporate gadfly," proposed a change that would have allowed
            shareholders to remove board directors without cause. He argued that
            it's not fair that employees do not have job security but directors do.
            The other proposal, by Kenneth Steiner, would have required the board to
            seek shareholder approval for so-called "golden parachute" pay
            packages for company executives when the value would be at least triple
            the executive's base salary and target short-term bonus. Southwest's
            board recommended shareholders oppose both proposals.</li>
        <li><strong>New board member elected </strong>- Shareholders elected
            Christopher Reynolds as a new director on the Southwest board. Reynolds
            has served as chief administrative officer of corporate resources for
            Toyota Motor North America, which has its headquarters in Plano, since
            2016. He also has been deputy chief officer for parent company Toyota
            Motor Corp. since 2014. Prior to joining Toyota in 2007, Reynolds was a
            partner at the law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in New York. The
            election of Reynolds coincides with the departure of Grace Leiblein from
            Southwest's board. She had served on Southwest's board since 2016.</li>
        <li><strong>Focused on restoring network </strong>- Throughout the meeting,
            Jordan spoke repeatedly about Southwest's focus on restoring its
            network. So far, Jordan said Southwest has restored about 80% of its
            service. He hopes to get that number up to 85% by the end of the year.
            During the pandemic, Southwest added 18 new airports to its route
            network. While Southwest had already eyed those destinations as growth
            opportunities, Jordan said they were "accelerated" to utilize idol
            assets and employees. Many of the new airports are smaller, but combined
            with new service to Hawaii that launched in 2019, they represent
            approximately 125 aircraft worth of growth. The restoration will center
            on bringing back service to markets where Southwest cut back during the
            pandemic but has typically had a dominant market share position. "It
            really is all about bringing back and restoring our network because
            those added frequencies and depth are good for our employees and good
            for our customers," Jordan said.</li>
        <li><strong>Will Southwest expand to more new markets? </strong>- Jordan
            said Southwest will look at expanding to new markets after it completes
            its restoration but didn't cite any specific locations. Executives were
            asked specifically about whether Canada could be a possible destination.
            Andrew Watterson, executive vice president and chief commercial officer,
            said Canada "will be one of the ones we look at but it will be a long
            list."</li>
        <li><strong>Dividend coming back in 2023 </strong>- Southwest executives
            were asked about when they plan to restore dividends. The company
            offered dividends for years but has not distributed one since 2020.
            Jordan said the federal CARES Act prohibited airlines from distributing
            dividends as a condition for receiving pandemic relief funds. That
            restriction lifts in September, and Jordan said the company hopes to
            start distributing dividends again in 2023.</li>
        <li><strong>Will continue only doing 737 aircraft </strong>- Shareholders
            also asked Southwest executives if the company has plans to expand its
            fleet beyond Boeing 737 aircraft. Jordan said using one type of aircraft
            helps Southwest operate efficiently and simplifies training for pilots.
            "It's a key portion of how we operate the airline and maintain our low
            costs and our low-fare advantage," Jordan said. The carrier always has
            to be open to surveying the market, but Jordan said Southwest remains
            committed to working with Boeing.</li>
